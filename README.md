# Group 4 â€“ Walkies 

## Goal: 
Configure the UniTree Go2 Edu and BostonDynamics SPOT robot dogs to run ROS2 Humble drivers, interface with attached sensors, and move autonomously. 

## Preparation in Advance: 
- Install ROS2 Humble (native Ubuntu or Docker image) and VS Code
- UniTree Go 2 resources: [UniTree Go 2 ROS2](https://github.com/unitreerobotics/unitree_ros2)
- SPOT resources: [SPOT Platform ROS2](https://github.com/LCAS/spot_platform)
- Notable ROS2 Packages: [Nav2](https://github.com/ros-navigation/navigation2), [Robot Localisation](https://github.com/cra-ros-pkg/robot_localization)

## Activities:
### Primary Activity:
`ROS2 Functionality` - Setup onboard configuration for ROS2 Humble on the Go2 and SPOT. Validating key sensor data access (LiDAR, RTK, Magnetometer), teleoperation capabilities (Joy). 

### Secondary Activity:
`ROS2 Autonomy` - Complete robot configuration with configuration of autonomy deployment with Nav2, advanced localisation with EKF, and assess the viability of SLAM approaches for (literal) in-field mapping of open spaces. 

### Stretch Activity:
`ROS2 Remote Monitoring` - Work with Group 2, integrating LoRa-based radio control for long-range communication and deploy an RViZ-based dashboard for remote teleoperation and monitoring. 

## Outcomes:
Through these activities, members will gain hands-on experience configuring a robot to run ROS2 drivers, integrate sensors and setup autonomy software stacks.

## Future Engagement:
With the robot dogs configured, members will have opportunity to engage further in experimenting with field robot challenges such as optimising in-field localisation, locomotion over uneven terrain, and autonomous navigation around dynamic and unpredictable obstacles.
